q3_1_1,"Typically, studies that analyze preexisting observational datasets (such as the ALSPAC dataset) are:

Trustworthy—meaning that the results and conclusions of the publications are valid, reliable, rigorous, and accurate. That they merit trust.

Reproducible—in the sense that other researchers re-analysing the data with the same research question would produce similar results. - Trustworthy",typically_trustworthy

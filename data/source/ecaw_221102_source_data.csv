Q4: If I have understood correctly, one issue I see with ECAW is that researchers can dredge the preliminary data for promising results before preregistering and getting the final full dataset, so doesn't necessarily stop some of the questionable research practices (p-hacking, HARKing, etc.) that pre-registration aims to overcome. Hence why, given the choice, I would prefer standard preregistration.","My main reservation, mentioned previously, is that an ECAW doesn't necessarily protect against p-hacking, fishing and HARKing. Perhaps an initial pre-registration prior to receiving the preliminary data, which can then be updated after the exploratory phase, might help get around this - But then that means more work as essentially it's both a full preregistrations and an ECAW!

I can definitely see the benefit of an ECAW in terms of using the preliminary data to produce and finalise analysis scripts, however.","Most organisations like ALSPAC - with good reason - do not allow researchers to made data publicly-available. This hinders both open-ness and reproducibility.

My concern is that some techniques I use, like imputation models, may work in the small data set then the code fail to work in the complete data set (if e.g. variables were revealed to be colinear in the full sample analyses), so I think it would be naive to assume the small sample analysis would  seamlessly apply to the full sample analysis.

Similarly, analysis on a small dataset might not work as there might not be sufficient units in a cell, whereas it would be fine when the whole data is available. I think that the ECAW model would not work for everyone. ",See previous comment. I am really concerned that making ALSPAC available only with ECAW would discourage many researchers to work with the data. There are already significant barriers to work with ALSPAC.,,"Yes.

Suppose the subset is so small as to be incapable of giving meaningful answers, but gives a large (but highly imprecise) association in the researcher's expected direction. The temptation will be to see this as confirmation of their prior beliefs, which just needs confirming with greater sample size. This could then lead to analytical methods and publication decisions with the full dataset depending on whether the results fit the reinforced prior expectations.
Another issue is that the appropriate analytical approach might depend on the sample size.","I sometimes develop my analysis plans on simulated data. This can have the same sample size as the real data and will not tease me with hints as to the result I might get to my research question. The problem is that the real data will sometimes have inconvenient patterns of missingness or (co-) distribution which I didn't simulate.

Q4: If I have understood correctly, one issue I see with ECAW is that researchers can dredge the preliminary data for promising results before preregistering and getting the final full dataset, so doesn't necessarily stop some of the questionable research practices (p-hacking, HARKing, etc.) that pre-registration aims to overcome.

Suppose the subset is so small as to be incapable of giving meaningful answers, but gives a large (but highly imprecise) association in the researcher's expected direction. The temptation will be to see this as confirmation of their prior beliefs, which just needs confirming with greater sample size. This could then lead to analytical methods and publication decisions with the full dataset depending on whether the results fit the reinforced prior expectations.
Another issue is that the appropriate analytical approach might depend on the sample size.","I sometimes develop my analysis plans on simulated data. This can have the same sample size as the real data and will not tease me with hints as to the result I might get to my research question. The problem is that the real data will sometimes have inconvenient patterns of missingness or (co-) distribution which I didn't simulate. Rather than providing subsets of the real data, could data providers supply synthetic data to researchers developing their analysis plans? They could make it more realistic than the researcher's own guesses but leave the main effect of interest null.",No,somewhat more concerned,20,"Stata,R",NA,"I sometimes wonder how robust the linkage is of cohort members to subsequent events/data, especially in the UK without a single national ID number.

For example some software might be limited by sample size, eg. HYDRA or other computationally demanding methods. You may need to run it on a system that has more computing power, but perhaps it ran ok on a local computer but when presented with the full dataset it has problems. Finally, would it be a problem for getting models to converge? ie. Might find a suitable model for the subset of data but when trying to run on the full sample you find the model doesn't converge or does not fit well? Not sure if that would be a problem or not.

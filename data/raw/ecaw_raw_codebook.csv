typically_trustworthy,"Typically, studies that analyze preexisting observational datasets (such as the ALSPAC dataset) are:

Trustworthy—meaning that the results and conclusions of the publications are valid, reliable, rigorous, and accurate. That they merit trust.

Reproducible—in the sense that other researchers re-analysing the data with the same research question would produce similar results. - Trustworthy"

alspac_less_willing,"Thinking about a study you may run with ALSPAC data (or one that you have recently run)... - If ALSPAC required that I use an ECAW, I would be less willing to use their data in my research"
alspac_opt_in,"Thinking about a study you may run with ALSPAC data (or one that you have recently run)... - If ALSPAC ran a study on ECAWs, I would opt-in."
alspac_study,Thinking about a study you may run with ALSPAC data (or one that you have recently run)... - ALSPAC should run a study on ECAWs.
alspac_prefer_ecaw,Thinking about a study you may run with ALSPAC data (or one that you have recently run)... - I would prefer using an ECAW than using typical preregistration
unsure_explain,"Optional Question.
If you disagreed or are unsure about any of these four questions, please explain why here."
drawback_ecaw,"Optional Question.
Do you have any thoughts you would like to share regarding the benefits and drawbacks of an ECAW, or about how this workflow could be improved? Do you have any reservations about this workflow? Would you need additional incentives to use this workflow? What type of incentives would you want? Respond to as many or as few of these questions as you would like."
suggestions,"Optional Question.
Do you have any suggestions for other research practices or policies that data managent organisations could implement to improve the quality of work output from their dataset?"
contact,May the research team contact you about potential focus groups related to the themes of this survey.
concerned,"Compared to what you think of as a typical researcher who uses preexisting observational data in your field, how concerned are you with research trustworthiness, bias, rigour, and reproducibility."
n_studies,"Approximately how many studies have you published using a preexisting observational dataset (e.g., the ALSPAC dataset)?"
